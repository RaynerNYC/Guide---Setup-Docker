# Docker
A program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization"
Images are like classes that are instantiated to create containers while containers are created from "images" that specify their precise contents.

Docker allows the creation of images and is used to run software packages called "containers". 
All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and is more lightweight than VM (virtual machines). 

Because Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously.
