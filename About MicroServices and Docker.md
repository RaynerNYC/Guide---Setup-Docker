# Mircoservices
Microservice means developing a single, small, meaningful functional feature as single service.
Each service has it's own process and communicate with lightweight mechanism. 
They focused on a specific feature / business requirement.

- loosely coupled (independent, in terms of development and deployment).
- can be developed using different programming languages
- allow to integrate automatic deployment with Continous Integration tools (eg: Jenkins, Hudson, bamboo etc.. ).
- separation of code allow fast development and focused work with easier to understand/modify/maintain microservice.
- easy to scale


# Docker
A program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization"
Images are like classes that are instantiated to create containers while containers are created from "images" that specify their precise contents.

Docker allows the creation of images and is used to run software packages called "containers". 
All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and is more lightweight than VM (virtual machines). 

Because Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously.
